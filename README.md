### What I learned

I have learned how to put an image in the middle of a div, by decreasing the width.

html code

<div class="content">
      <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Image">
      <p class="p-1">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
      <p class="p-2">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>

Css code

.content img{
  width: 90%;
  border-radius: 20px;
  margin: 20px;
}
